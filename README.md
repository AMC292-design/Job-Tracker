Overview: Browser web-based browser job tracker.

Description: This project is a web-based browser job tracker. The job tracker enables current job seekers
an all-in-one place to manually keep track of their job searches and the current status of their particular 
jobs applied to. The job tracker's simplistic and minimalistic build allows job seekers to focus on easily
navigating the website and the easy-to-use features such as inputting the information, saving it, having the 
option to update existing information or the job status, and deleting entries upon their choosing. Job seekers
have the autonomy for each entry to be reflected as the user so chooses, thus allowing for a user-friendly experience, 
which was intended for the job tracker.
